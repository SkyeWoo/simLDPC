# simLDPC
Our 2nd Information Theory group-homework. 

We use MATLAB to simulate the decoding algorithm of LDPC, namely, bit flipping (BF) decoding algorithm. 

In the simulation, we
1) 	Generate a parity check matrix of LDPC with size 256Ã—512.
2) Use the BF algorithm to decode a codeword generated by using 1).
3) Give the bit error probability of decoding algorithm when the SNR is 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 dB with BPSK modulation and AWGN channels.
